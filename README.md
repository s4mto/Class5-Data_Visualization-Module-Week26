# Class5-Data_Visualization-Module-Week26
# Using the databases we used in the lesson, you can create a 2-page dashboard that highlights data like the one below. I request you to create "features" that are not directly included in the tables by creating new "calculated columns" and "measures".
- Total number of installments
- Loan expiry date
- Number of remaining installments
- Unpaid loan amount
- Total loan amount
- Total commission amount
- Ratio of commissions to total credit
- Total amount of loan paid
- Average loan amount
- Average maturity period (months)
- You can visualize this data by years, loan types, branches and cities.
