# 📊 Class 5 – Data Visualization Project (Week 26)

This project showcases a 2-page Power BI dashboard developed using sample loan datasets provided during class. The objective is to go beyond the raw data by creating meaningful features through **calculated columns** and **DAX measures**, and to visualize key financial metrics across multiple dimensions such as **years**, **loan types**, **branches**, and **cities**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Design a clean, interactive, and insightful 2-page Power BI dashboard.
- Create new features not directly available in the tables using DAX.
- Enable users to analyze loan data through dynamic visuals and filters.

---

## 🧮 Calculated Columns & Measures

The following custom features were created using DAX:

- **Total Number of Installments**
- **Loan Expiry Date**
- **Number of Remaining Installments**
- **Unpaid Loan Amount**
- **Total Loan Amount**
- **Total Commission Amount**
- **Commission-to-Loan Ratio**
- **Total Amount of Loan Paid**
- **Average Loan Amount**
- **Average Maturity Period (in Months)**

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard allows users to explore the following dimensions:

- **Year**  
- **Loan Type**  
- **Branch**  
- **City**  

Users can filter and interact with the data to uncover patterns, trends, and performance metrics across different segments.
